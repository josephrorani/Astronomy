      <div class="info"><h3>Rocket</h3>
        <p>The first rockets were invented in China In The 1200's. Rockets back then were used for fireworks and armies used them in wars. As the years past by,the more solid, bigger and stronger the rockets became. The first ever rocket fuelled by a liquid propellant was made by an American Engineer named Robert H. Goddard. We humans managed to get the first men into space by using the massive Saturn V Rocket on July 20th, 1969. Rockets have been running for a while. They help bring supplies to space stations orbiting the world. Rockets will be used in the trip to Mars where astronauts will be sent on a one way trip mission. They are also used to get Satellites into orbit.</p>

        <h3>Satellites</h3>
        <P>A Satellite is something that orbits a planet or star. Earth is like of a Satellite because it orbits the Sun. There are lots of Satellites orbiting the globe right now. Some Satellites take pictures to give Meteorologists infomation to predict the weather or track hurricanes. The biggest Satellite orbiting Earth right now is The International Space Station. It is the most expensive project ever built. It cost $150 Billion US Dollars! The International Space Station is about the size of a football field even though the International Space Station is as roomy as a five-bedroom house</P> 
        <h4>Facts</h4>
        <p> - In October 1957, the Soviet Union launched Sputnik 1 which was the world's first artificial satellite to be sent into space orbit.</p>
        <p> - The speed a satellite must travel to stay in space is called its orbital velocity. It usually needs to be more than 17,500 mph (28,200 km/h).</p>
        <p> - The International Space Station (ISS) is the largest artificial satellite currently orbiting Earth.</p>
