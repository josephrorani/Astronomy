      <div class="info"><h3>Astronomy</h3>
        <p>Astronomy is the study of space beyond Earth's Atmosphere. Astronomy is a branch of Science which deals with celestial objects, space, and the physical universe as a whole. Astronomy is also a branch of Physics. The name 'Astronomy' comes from the Greek word 'astron' which means star and 'nomos' for arrangment in law. Astronomy studies the Solar System and all the planets that orbit our Sun and others. In addition to planets, Astronomy also studies moons, comets, asteroids and different types of gases. The first 'official' Astronomer was Claudius Ptolemy who used Hipparchus' ( Greek Astronome, Geographer And Mathematician ) extensive observations to develop a model that predicted the movements of the Sun, Moon, planets, and stars. </p>
        <h3>Braches Of Astronomy</h3>       
        <p>Astrobiology â€“ studies the advent and evolution of biological systems in the universe.</p>
        <p>Planetary astronomers - focus on the growth, evolution, and death of planets, while solar astronomers spend their time analyzing a single star, our sun. Stellar astronomers turn their eyes to the stars which includes black holes.</p>
        <p>Galactic astronomers - study our galaxy, the Milky Way, while extragalactic astronomers peer outside of it to determine how these collections of stars form, change, and die.</p>
        <h4>Facts</h4>
        <p> - Cockroaches raised in space become quicker, stronger, faster, and tougher than cockroaches on Earth.</p>
        <p> - On August 10, 2015, NASA astronauts ate food that had been grown in space for the first time.</p>
        <p> - In 1962, the U.S. blew up a hydrogen bomb in space that was 100 times more powerful than Hiroshima.</p>
